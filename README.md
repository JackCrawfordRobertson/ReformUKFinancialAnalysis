ReformUK Financial Analysis Project Setup
=========================================

This document guides you through setting up the Python environment required for the `ReformUKFinancialAnalysis` project using Anaconda.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before you begin, ensure that you have Anaconda installed on your system. If you do not have Anaconda installed, please visit the Anaconda Installation Guide for instructions on how to download and install the software.

Creating the Environment
------------------------

To create a dedicated Python environment for this project, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Open Your Terminal

Start by opening your terminal. You can use Terminal on macOS, Command Prompt on Windows, or your preferred shell on Linux.

### Step 2: Create the Environment

Execute the following command to create a new Conda environment named `ReformUKFinancialAnalysis` with Python 3.8:

sh

Copy code

`conda create -n ReformUKFinancialAnalysis python=3.8`

You will see a list of packages that will be installed in the new environment. Confirm the installation by typing `y` when prompted.

### Step 3: Activate the Environment

Once the environment is created, you can activate it using:

sh

Copy code

`conda activate ReformUKFinancialAnalysis`

Your terminal prompt should now reflect that you are inside the `ReformUKFinancialAnalysis` environment.

### Step 4: Verify Installation

To ensure that the environment is set up correctly, you can check the Python version:

sh

Copy code

`python --version`

This should output `Python 3.8.19` or the version you chose to install.

Managing Packages
-----------------

If you need to install additional Python packages, use `pip` or `conda` while the environment is activated. For example:

sh

Copy code

`pip install numpy`

or

sh

Copy code

`conda install numpy`

Deactivating the Environment
----------------------------

To exit the environment, you can deactivate it by running:

sh

Copy code

`conda deactivate`

Conclusion
----------

This setup ensures that you have a clean and controlled development environment specific to the `ReformUKFinancialAnalysis` project, helping you manage dependencies effectively and avoid conflicts with other Python projects.
